First day of a new job.  
Work-from-home, hotel reservations, commission-based 
a strange frontier to step into.  
It will demand a kind of endurance I’m still learning:  
pushing through my hesitation to speak up, 
navigating other people’s confusion,  
trying to find my own clear voice inside the noise.  
Just a morning thought.

As usual, I drifted into sleep around 1 AM.  
Another night falling down the UX / web-development rabbit hole,  
studying layouts, tools, and strange little details that 
make the internet feel alive. Somewhere in that late-night fog, 
a plan started forming:

**Next year’s goal:**  
build my own website from scratch —  
a real home for my art, my code, my experiments.  
And maybe, step by step, look for work as a UX designer or developer.  
Not chasing status, not trying to be “the best.”  
Just wanting to learn, to create,  
to solve problems in ways that feel like magic.

This field journal is part of that path.  
A place to track what I’m learning,  
to mark the small shifts and discoveries,  
to keep myself moving toward something better.  
A record of progress, mistakes, and knowledge —  
breadcrumbs for the version of me who will read this later.

Today we to bed at 1 ambecause I played around with my liquid simulation 
code in P5.Js, now I'm at the version 008  and still upgrading. creating more 
liquid flow motion not by adding more speed but by adding more stillness to 
the liquid drop, as usual I crossed my girlfriend to San Diego to work and 
returned home to play more with the "liquidSim", I'm trying to reach out more
people to my art, still trying a lot of web3 pages and trying to get commissions 
out of anywhere I can find. 

//-------------------- 22:04 -------------------------------
it night and I didn't say down to program my p5.js sketches, they discoected 
our gas line and I had to resolved that issue. I did had a visit from a glitch 
enthusiasm friend: Luis (Happysnacks) and we ended up talking about diferent 
glitched and AI tools, we are trying to reach out people and money by doing
live videos on diferent platforms, with the goal of getting paid for doing our art, 
and trying to create a series of events with out brand: Liquid Glitch.
