Processing all of this information might seem basic to others,
but under the weight of unstable income and unresolved family fractures,
everything feels heavier.

If I’m going to learn a programming language, it has to serve a purpose.
This can’t just be curiosity for curiosity’s sake.
I need traction.
I need momentum.
Always upgrading — paulo++.

Keeping my chin up is work.
A few months ago, a dispute with a promoter around my VJ / artist gigs
left a deeper mark than I expected.
Not because of the money,
but because I still struggle to be treated with basic respect.
I get talked over.
I get cornered.
I get worn down.
And lately, I’m tired of it.

//-------------------- 22:00 -------------------------

I keep trying to become my best version,
but it feels like a balancing act I keep losing —
tightening one area while another slips loose.

Still, I know this:
I have a strange, specific set of skills.
An uncommon curiosity.
A wide net of interests that, if aligned correctly,
could carry my life somewhere meaningful.

Not toward money — toward purpose.
Toward a way of living well *through* my art.

That’s why this journal exists.
Not to perform.
Not to convince.
Just to speak — for whoever happens to listen.
To speak out loud so I can feel heard, even if only by the page.

I don’t often feel respected.
I don’t feel heard at home.
I ran from my family.
My father doesn’t speak to me.
I can’t see my daughter.
It’s a lot to carry.

And all I want, sometimes,
is a single day that doesn’t feel like survival.
Not escape.
Not denial.
Just the quiet assurance that my life isn’t ending,
that it doesn’t dissolve into meaninglessness.

I want to believe there’s more ahead.
That this path leads somewhere worth reaching.

First day of a new job.  
Work-from-home, hotel reservations, commission-based 
a strange frontier to step into.  
It will demand a kind of endurance I’m still learning:  
pushing through my hesitation to speak up, 
navigating other people’s confusion,  
trying to find my own clear voice inside the noise.  
Just a morning thought.

As usual, I drifted into sleep around 1 AM.  
Another night falling down the UX / web-development rabbit hole,  
studying layouts, tools, and strange little details that 
make the internet feel alive. Somewhere in that late-night fog, 
a plan started forming:

**Next year’s goal:**  
build my own website from scratch —  
a real home for my art, my code, my experiments.  
And maybe, step by step, look for work as a UX designer or developer.  
Not chasing status, not trying to be “the best.”  
Just wanting to learn, to create,  
to solve problems in ways that feel like magic.

This field journal is part of that path.  
A place to track what I’m learning,  
to mark the small shifts and discoveries,  
to keep myself moving toward something better.  
A record of progress, mistakes, and knowledge —  
breadcrumbs for the version of me who will read this later.

Today we went to bed at 1 am because I played around with my liquid simulation 
code in P5.Js, now I'm at version 008 and still upgrading. Creating more 
liquid flow motion not by adding speed but by adding stillness to the liquid 
drop. As usual I crossed my girlfriend to San Diego to work and 
returned home to play more with "liquidSim". I'm trying to reach out more
people with my art, still trying a lot of web3 pages and trying to get commissions 
out of anywhere I can find. 

//-------------------- 22:04 -------------------------------
It's night and I didn't sit down to program my p5.js sketches — they disconnected 
our gas line and I had to resolve that issue. I did get a visit from a glitch 
enthusiast friend: Luis (Happysnacks), and we ended up talking about 
different glitches and AI tools. We're trying to reach people and money by doing
live videos on different platforms, with the goal of getting paid for doing our art, 
and trying to create a series of events with our brand: Liquid Glitch.
